# Fake News Detection Model Evaluation

This repository contains the evaluation results of a fake news detection model using three different classifiers: k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes.

## Model Performance Metrics

### kNN Classifier
- **Accuracy on Training Set:** 99.76%
- **Accuracy on Test Set:** 68.29%

### SVM Classifier (Tuned Hyperparameters)
- **Accuracy on Training Set:** 93.54%
- **Accuracy on Test Set:** 74.15%

### Naive Bayes Classifier
- **Accuracy on Training Set:** 88.11%
- **Accuracy on Test Set:** 71.95%

## Conclusion
The models show varying degrees of accuracy in classifying fake news articles. While SVM performs the best among the three classifiers on the test set, further optimization and feature engineering may improve overall performance.
